# The code is quite messy, with a mix of magic numbers thrown in for good measure, and my rambling notes - so i appologies to any unfortunate soul who choses to read it!
# Also, im aware that my choice to manually check all the possible starting location which could constitute a winning move isnt a very intelligent way of doing it - could have tried to check around each piece played maybe? However, i didnt want to spend too much time on this - as it was just a bit of fun to do after my exams - thank god they're over!
# That being said i, of course, welcome any and all constructive critism and possible ways to implement a more effiecent checking system - and i may come back to this and try to improve it later.
